		<h2>A creative person 🎨</h2>
		<p>
			I am passionate about creation. I started by doing some drawing, painting and other artistics methods. In parallel, I learned to do some video editing, especillay with iMovie. As a kid I used it for doing litlle movies, today it is more about editing travel videos, and using the tool for more professional needs. Indeed, I use my skills for the association ACT, by doing some of their communication,.

		<h2>Intercultural skills 🗺️</h2>
		<p>
			I also like to develop my intercultural skills, by traveling, meeting new people and cultures. I find the diversity of different cultures fascinating. By the way, I am binational French-English and speak both languages fluently, and I also learn German.

		<h2>Associative experience 💫</h2>
		<p>
			My first engagements were in highschool. In particular, I did small solidarity actions, such as collecting products for people in need or welcoming a young migrant for Christmas dinner. Today, I am concretizing my commitment as a full member of the IÉSEG student association ACT.

		<p  id="association"> 
			ACT is an association aimed at promoting eco-responsibility at IÉSEG Lille. The objective is to make the iéseg campus carbon neutral by 2025. My main role, as a member of the communication pole, is to create content for social media. It means this means making publications and stories for facebook and instagram, warning of our future events. I also make content with the aim of being attractive and making students aware of various subjects concerning ecology.
